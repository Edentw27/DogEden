"""
main.py  —  RoboDog full pipeline
==================================

    voice command  ->  parse colour+shape  ->  camera scan  ->  robot action

Runs in TWO modes automatically:
  * On your laptop (no xgolib)  -> SIMULATION: prints the action.
  * On the robot   (xgolib ok)  -> REAL: moves the dog via dog.action(id).

Vision: pure HSV colour + contour analysis (no trained model needed).
Voice:  Google Speech Recognition via the SpeechRecognition library.
